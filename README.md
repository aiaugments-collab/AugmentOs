## 
🌐 AugmentOS is a chromium fork that runs AI agents natively.

🔒 Privacy first - use your own API keys or run local models with Ollama. Your data stays on your computer.

💡 Help us build the future of AI-powered browsing!

## Quick start

1. Build and install AugmentOS from source

2. Import your Chrome data (optional)

3. Connect your AI provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, or local models via Ollama/LMStudio)

4. Start automating!

## What makes AugmentOS special
- 🏠 Feels like home - same familiar interface as Google Chrome, works with all your extensions
- 🤖 AI agents that run on YOUR browser, not in the cloud
- 🔒 Privacy first - bring your own keys or use local models with Ollama. Your browsing history stays on your computer
- 🚀 Community driven - see exactly what's happening under the hood
- 🤝 MCP store to one-click install popular MCPs and use them directly in the browser bar
- 🛡️ (coming soon) Built-in AI ad blocker that works across more scenarios!  

## Demos

AugmentOS provides powerful AI-powered browsing capabilities including:

- **AI Agent Automation**: Intelligent agents that can perform complex browsing tasks
- **Chat Integration**: Seamless AI chat functionality within the browser
- **Data Scraping**: Automated data extraction and processing capabilities

## Why We're Building AugmentOS

For the first time since Netscape pioneered the web in 1994, AI gives us the chance to completely reimagine the browser. We've seen tools like Cursor deliver 10x productivity gains for developers—yet everyday browsing remains frustratingly archaic.

You're likely juggling 70+ tabs, battling your browser instead of having it assist you. Routine tasks, like "reorder Tide Pods from my Amazon history," should be handled seamlessly by intelligent AI agents.

At AugmentOS, we're convinced that AI should empower you by automating tasks locally and securely—keeping your data private. We are building the best browser for this future!

## How we compare

<details>
<summary><b>vs Chrome</b></summary>
<br>
While we're grateful for Google open-sourcing Chromium, but Chrome hasn't evolved much in 10 years. No AI features, no automation, no MCP support.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>vs Brave</b></summary>
<br>
We love what Brave started, but they've spread themselves too thin with crypto, search, VPNs. We're laser-focused on AI-powered browsing.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>vs Arc/Dia</b></summary>
<br>
Many loved Arc, but it was closed source. When they abandoned users, there was no recourse. We're community-driven and transparent!
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>vs Perplexity Comet</b></summary>
<br>
They're a search/ad company. Your browser history becomes their product. We keep everything local.
</details>
